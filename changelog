Includes all changes and bugfixes from the latest upstream NTMain update - [X5453 - tragic yuri in a can](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5453)

## Added
* Space stations now emit a gentle, soothing hum inside pressurized rooms (a la ST:TNG), this can be muted/modified with `/ntmclient set AUDIO_SHIP_HUM_VOLUME [0.0 - 1.0]`

## Changed
* Basalt now has cobblestone oredict
* Earth crystalline bedrock is now: Redstone - Asbestos - Diamond - Emerald
    * This means an Earth bedrock plant can produce all basic alloys! (Steel, Red Copper, Advanced Alloy)
* Duna now spawns repairable lanterns (at double the rate of Earth!)
* Schrabidium ore generates naturally on Eve
* Ike now has rad hotspots
* Red keyholes now spawn on all planets
* Space stations now see the satellites of the currently orbited body, allowing asteroid miners to function (but only when orbiting the correct planet!)
* Extra port added to the Electrolyser
* Platinum was kill (it was unused)
* Bigger, Better, And More Uncut Biome Crash Message (I will cut your bals off if you don't read it)
* PLSS now consumes oxygen when underwater, you'll drown as normal if you run out of O2

## Fixed
* PLSS audio sometimes doesn't play when multiple players with PLSSes are present in a given dimension
* "Unnamed" bedrock ore that causes crashes when inserted into a Bedrock Ore Processor
* A whole chunk of `Block` is allocated unnecessarily during structure generation
* Gas dock visually shows Jool Gas even on Tekto
* Crash with certain mods trying to spawn entities with a FakeWorld (why)
* Small custom missiles don't work (restored the UI elements that indicate what thrusters work with what warheads)
