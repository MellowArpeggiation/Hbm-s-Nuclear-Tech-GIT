## Added
* Heavy duty electricity connector
  * Upgraded version of the standard model
  * Two times as chunky, ten times as powerful
  * Ideal for custom pylon designs
* Two new expensive mode items
  * Ultra fine gold dust, which can be combined with ferric schrabidate in the particle accelerator to create degenerate matter
  * Degenerate matter, which is used instead of regular ferric schrabidate in the exposure chamber to create DNT

## Changed
* Snow golems now use the grey metallic gib particles instead of blood
* The heavy magnetic storage tank now uses BSCCO instead of AA
* Increased the industrial steam turbine's throughput to 150mB/t of UDS exactly
  * In addition to being an almost 50% buff, this also fixes the slight issue where turbine chains couldn't reach 100% throughput
* The remants power armor melee ability now has a refire check, meaning the attack will be repeated automatically if the attack button is held down
  * ATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA
* Power armor melee attacks now detect entities with a hitbox that's 0.5 blocks larger in all directions, making it substantially easier to hit small targets
* As a side effect, this also increases the maximum range by 0.5 blocks

## Fixed
* Fixed chemical factory internal tank sharing ignoring tank pressure
* Fixed the NCR ranger power armor missing most protection stats
* Fixed LPS pipes not properly connecting to the new industrial turbines
* Fixed NCRPA missing radiation resistance stats (it's 97% for the full set)
* Fixed NCRPA chestplate giving night vision even without a full set
* Probably fixed the fused meteorite sword recipe being missing (untested)
* Decreased the fusing difficulty of chlorine and calcium in the ICF which should hopefully make ClCa fuel pellets usable (untested)
* Fixed loot piles only having a single block render AABB, causing armor rewards from red rooms to blink out of existence at certain angles
* Fixed filled crate blocks not dropping crate items with a stack lock in place
* Fixed stack lock not being applied when an item crate is opened, allowing them to be stacked while the item is open
