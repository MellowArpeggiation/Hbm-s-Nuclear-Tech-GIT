Includes all changes and bugfixes from the latest upstream NTMain update - [X5523 - fusion rework, one week away](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT/releases/tag/1.0.27_X5523)

## Added
* Animated orbital transfers for _all_ rockets, not just orbital stations!
    * Sun occlusion is now calculated using the eclipse code, no more random darkness during transfers!
    * Improvements to the orbital transfer animations for improved accuracy are planned
        * Fuel calculations _are_ already accurate though, using derived dV based on Hohmann transfers
* Oxygen-Rich Air - found on Earth and Laythe
    * All your setups will automatically use this fluid instead of compressed air, where applicable
* Minmus mint icecream and delicious Aussie Mint Slice biscuits
    * Mint plants will spawn in the same places strawberries do
* Orbital station launching port
    * Allows you to construct and launch rockets from orbital stations
    * The terrestial VAB and rocket launch pad no longer function in orbit
* Tekto bedrock oil
    * Avoid collecting this near your base, the fracking damage is a fair bit more pronounced than other bedrock deposits!
* Synthetic leather/pleather
    * Very useful for Martian playthroughs

## Changed
* Air intake is no longer decorative, can create compressed air
    * Will consume air inside pressurized rooms and convert it into compressed air at a 1:100 ratio
    * This means a klystron will consume 25mB/t of oxygen if used in an orbital station, just a tad more than the old fusion reactor consumed
* Stardar and drive processors now require blueprints to assemble, like the Soyuz recipes
* Entanglement kits now use krypton instead of xenon, which can be acquired on Earth after stainless steel
* T-51 armor can now be used as a spacesuit
* Minor circuit rework
    * Avionics chip added
    * Existing avionics chip renamed to astrionics unit
    * Cheaper military grade chips on Tekto!
* Murky wings can now descend properly when used in orbit

## Fixed
* Player models now tilt with rockets, no more feet sticking out during gravity turns
* Worldgen performance was poo poo, now it is 14x less poo poo (that's 28x less poo with RTG installed!)
* Crash with certain malformed rideable rockets
* Celestial world providers extended the wrong class, breaking oregen in GT
* Meteors spawning in non-surface modded dimensions (like AE2 spatial cells)
* Insane thunder spam when a dimension with no atmosphere is loaded
* Attempt at fixing station thrusters remaining "on"
