## Changed
* Updated russian localization
* Removed T45 protections entirely
* The ICF laser controller max output can now be adjusted in the config, both stats for the capacitors and turbochargers can be changed separately

## Fixed
* Fixed NCRPA and taurun armor not having working gas masks
* Refactored the armor system, stats like radiation and particle protection are no longer scattered over various registries, making future sets less likely to miss them
* Fixed crucible smeling one too many items with no template installed, causing the gauge to exceed the boundaries
* Potentially fixed another issue with artillery rocket targeting
